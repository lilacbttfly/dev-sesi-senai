   <h1>how does a bastard,</h1>
   <h2>orphan,</h2>
   <h3>son of a whore</h3>
   <h4>and a scottsman,</h4>

   <h4>and devastation reigned,</h4>
   <h5>the man saw his future</h5>
   <h6>drip-dripping down the drain.</h6>

   <h2>they said</h2>
   <h3>this kid is insane man</h3>
   <h4>took up a collection</h4>
   <h5>just to send him to the mainland</h5>
